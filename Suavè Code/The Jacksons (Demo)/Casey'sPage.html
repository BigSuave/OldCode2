        This is the rogue empire home of the bay area gladiators. Rogue Empire is more then just a marketing and management team but more like a family. I hope your ready, (opponents) if not your in for a rude awakening.

      <p>Although we may have not began as fighters, we have always been exposed to that life style. My father Eugene"The Wolf" Jackson is one of the early pioneers of the sport, when weight classes didn't exist and rounds went for 15 minutes long.Even though i was not drawn to the sport in my younger days it didn't take long for us to become that fight family.</p>

     <p>Bio: From the streets of East Palo Alto to the cage, ring or mat. I grew up involved in sports since 7 years old, from football, and basketball to wrestling, and track N field.Now im 20 and Mixed Martial arts from striking to grappling is my entire life . Personally i feel like i should be off at some D1 college playing football or running track N field but during high school for some reason i could never get the full concept of being a STUDENT athlete but only on being an athlete/jock which eventually got me kicked out of high school. It took me getting slapped around a little bit and finally taking a step back and evaluating my life and the direction i was headed to really get on track. Luckily sooner then later i found my direction and before i knew it i was transferring back to my original high school an pursuing my new found love in MMA (Mixed Martial Arts). Ever since then there has only been steps towards making progress in the direction I am headed. </p>
