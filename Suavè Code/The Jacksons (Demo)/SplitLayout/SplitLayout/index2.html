							<h2>Robert Peraz: Founder</h2>
							<p>I am currently a student at San Jose State University studying Graphic Design and Photography. I am also the creator and founder of Zepluz Clothing since 2010. Having the curiosity of how clothing line products were printed and established into successful company, was always a dream I had in mind to pursuit. Eventually I was fortunate to learn the silk screen process in high school.  Silk screening requires a lot of planning, and patience to obtain a work of one or more screens to create a promising work of art. With lots of practice and dedication I was able to make my own tools and ideas to create my early works through silk screening. Eventually I was determined to challenge myself in creating more excited designs that someday would be mass produced and admired by everyone. My long term goal with Zepluz Clothing is to provide premium quality products to our customers in order to keep my designs consistent and thrilling.</p>
