About me:
I am currently a student at San Jose State University studying Graphic Design and Photography. I am also the creator and founder of Zepluz Clothing since 2010. Having the curiosity of how clothing line products were printed and established into successful company, was always a dream I had in mind to pursuit. Eventually I was fortunate to learn the silk screen process in high school.  Silk screening requires a lot of planning, and patience to obtain a work of one or more screens to create a promising work of art. With lots of practice and dedication I was able to make my own tools and ideas to create my early works through silk screening. Eventually I was determined to challenge myself in creating more excited designs that someday would be mass produced and admired by everyone. My long term goal with Zepluz Clothing is to provide premium quality products to our customers in order to keep my designs consistent and thrilling. 
Seaside Design:
 It was my first design printed by a silk screening company that redefined my company with a new direction of a newly crafted logo and identity as a whole. I chose a ship help to resemble a new journey and direction for Zepluz Clothing, and a circular rope pattern to resemble unity and trust. Having the design printed in one color gave me the opportunity to work with geometric shapes and a vision of simplicity. 
21st Century Mayan:
I created this design to resemble my roots as a Mexican American. I recreated Mayan symbols that represent the culture of the humble beings worked hard to cultivate the land and hoped for great seasons to come in order to enjoy crops that would strengthen them and motivate them to continue the tradition of life. I also created a frame of circuit board patterns to resemble the present of myself living around innovating Silicon Valley.  I believe technology can unite the people, but the only way we can do this is by never forgetting the past. 
West Coast Living: 
This design represents the Californian culture from the North to the South. Geographically we are along by the Pacific Coast and historically there have been stories about sharks. Sharks and sea animals were appreciated by early native inhabitants, since it provided resources. Growing up in the Bay Area I noticed the diversity of cultures, especially the Polynesians. Although distinctive and unique they all have the value of family and unity of the community. I chose traditional patterns to resemble the people of the Pacific coast and the surrounding sharks to resemble unity. 
City Skyline:
This design consists of the traditional colors of the early California license plates. I really like the colors since they represent the Golden State of California. I created the Golden Gate Bridge and itâ€™s amazing city of San Francisco. I remember driving back home seeing the tall and abstract building lights and patterns that gave me appreciation of art. San Francisco diversity enables communities to unite and take part of making a difference in life.
